# Butlers Dashboard — Frontend & API Project Plan

> **Goal:** A "single pane of glass" web dashboard over the deployed butler infrastructure — topology, health, sessions, schedules, state, traces, costs, errors, skills, memory, and butler-specific domain data. Full read/write admin control. Not the primary interaction method (chat is), but the definitive place to understand what the system is doing, what it costs, and what's broken.

### Data Access Strategy

The dashboard API uses **two access patterns**:

| Pattern | When | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| **MCP client** | Real-time operations: `status()`, `trigger()`, `tick()`, butler discovery | These need live data from running daemons. Also the authoritative path for write operations. |
| **Direct DB reads** | Data browsing: sessions, schedules, state, contacts, measurements, entities | Efficient for paginated lists, search, aggregation. Reads from each butler's dedicated PostgreSQL DB. |

> **Note:** Direct DB reads are a pragmatic exception to the "strict DB isolation" rule. The dashboard is an administrative tool, not a butler. It reads but never writes to butler DBs directly — all writes go through MCP tools.

---

## Required Framework Change: Core `notify()` Tool

The dashboard's Notifications view depends on a framework-level addition: a core `notify()` tool on every butler. This solves the **outbound messaging gap** — currently butlers can receive work but cannot push messages to the user (e.g., reminders, alerts).

### The Problem

Butler CC instances are locked down to their own MCP server. A Health butler CC that discovers "medication due in 30 min" has no way to send a Telegram message — only the Switchboard has the `telegram` module. The current spec hand-waves with "store in state for Switchboard delivery" but there's no actual delivery mechanism.

### The Solution: Core `notify()` Tool

Every butler daemon holds an MCP client connection to the Switchboard. A new core tool, `notify()`, lets any CC instance send outbound messages:

```
Core Tools (addition)
└── notify(channel, message, recipient?)  → delivery result
```

**Flow:**
```
1. Health scheduler fires → CC spawns
2. CC checks medications, finds Metformin due
3. CC calls notify(channel="telegram", message="Time to take Metformin 500mg")
4. Health butler daemon → MCP client → Switchboard.deliver("telegram", message)
5. Switchboard's telegram module sends the message
6. Switchboard logs the notification in its DB
7. notify() returns delivery result to CC
```

**Implementation notes:**
- Synchronous from CC's perspective — `notify()` blocks until delivered (or fails)
- The Switchboard gets a new tool: `deliver(channel, message, recipient?, metadata?)` — distinct from `route()` which forwards tool calls to other butlers
- Notification log lives in the Switchboard's DB (it's the delivery authority)
- If Switchboard is unreachable, `notify()` returns an error — CC can store in state as fallback
- `channel` values: `telegram`, `email` (matches Switchboard's modules)
- `recipient` is optional — defaults to the system owner (personal system, single user for v1)

### Switchboard Notification Schema

```sql
-- Add to butler_switchboard database
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    source_butler TEXT NOT NULL,          -- which butler sent this
    channel TEXT NOT NULL,                -- 'telegram', 'email'
    recipient TEXT,                       -- chat_id, email address, or null for default
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}', -- arbitrary context (medication_id, contact_id, etc.)
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'sent',  -- 'sent', 'failed', 'pending'
    error TEXT,                           -- error message if failed
    session_id UUID,                      -- CC session that triggered this
    trace_id TEXT,                        -- OTel trace ID
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_source ON notifications(source_butler, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_channel ON notifications(channel, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_status ON notifications(status);
```

> **This is a framework change, not a dashboard change.** It needs to be added to `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and implemented before the dashboard's notification features work. The dashboard just reads from this table and provides visibility.

## Pages & Views

### 1. Overview Dashboard (`/`)

The landing page. At-a-glance system health. Answers: "Is everything OK? What just happened? What's it costing me?"

**Components:**

- **Topology graph** (React Flow): Interactive node diagram showing:
  - Switchboard node (center) with edges to each butler
  - Heartbeat node with dashed edges to all butlers
  - Each node shows: name, port, status badge (healthy/degraded/down), module count
  - **Active session indicator**: Node pulses/glows when a CC instance is currently running
  - Click a node → navigate to butler detail
  - Edge labels: "MCP route", "tick"
  - Module dependency health: small colored dots per module on each node (green=connected, red=unreachable)

- **Aggregate stats bar**: Total butlers, active/healthy count, total sessions today, failed sessions, avg response time, **estimated cost today**

- **Issues panel** (prominent, top of page when non-empty):
  - Unreachable butlers (status: down)
  - Failing scheduled tasks (N consecutive failures)
  - Module dependency failures (e.g., "telegram: bot token invalid", "email: IMAP connection refused")
  - Cost anomalies (butler spending >2x its 7-day average)
  - Each issue: severity badge (critical/warning), butler name, short description, link to detail
  - Dismissable per-issue (stores dismissed state locally)

- **Cost summary widget**: Today's spend, 7-day trend sparkline, top spender butler. Links to full cost view.

- **Recent activity feed**: Last N events across all butlers — not just sessions but a **unified timeline** mixing:
  - CC sessions (with success/fail, duration, token count)
  - Scheduled task dispatches
  - Routing decisions (Switchboard)
  - Heartbeat ticks (collapsed — "Heartbeat: 5 butlers ticked")

  ── switchboard.receive (telegram, chat_id=123)  [0ms]
     └── switchboard.classify                      [200ms]
         └── switchboard.route → health            [5ms]
             └── health.trigger                    [50ms]
                 └── health.cc_session             [3200ms]
                     ├── health.tool.measurement_log  [15ms]
                     ├── health.tool.state_set        [8ms]
                     └── health.tool.sessions_log     [12ms]
  ```
- Each span shows: name, duration, key attributes
- Click span → expanded attributes panel

### 6. Global Search (`Cmd+K`)

A command palette / search bar accessible from anywhere via `Cmd+K` (or `/`).

**Searches across:**
- Sessions (by prompt content, result text)
- State store keys and values (across all butlers)
- Scheduled task names and prompts
- Contacts (Relationship butler: name, company, notes)
- Entities (General butler: title, tags, data content)
- Research notes (Health butler: topic, title, content)
- Skills (name, SKILL.md content)

**Behavior:**
- Results grouped by category with icons (session, contact, entity, etc.)
- Each result: title, subtitle (butler name + category), snippet with match highlighted
- Enter → navigate to the detail view for that result
- Debounced search (300ms), shows recent searches when empty
- Backed by a single API endpoint that fans out across butler DBs

### 7. Unified Timeline (`/timeline`)

A chronological "what happened?" view mixing all event types across all butlers. The system's activity log.

**Event types (each with distinct icon and color):**
- CC session started/completed (with success/fail, duration, cost)
- Scheduled task dispatched
- Routing decision (Switchboard: message arrived → routed to butler)
- **Notification sent** (butler → Switchboard → telegram/email, with delivery status)
- Heartbeat tick (collapsible — "Heartbeat: 5 butlers ticked, 0 failures")
- State change (key set/deleted, with butler name and key)
- Error/failure (session failure, module error, unreachable butler, **notification delivery failure**)

**Controls:**
- Butler filter (multi-select)
- Event type filter (multi-select)
- Date range picker
- Auto-refresh toggle (poll every 10s)
- Infinite scroll (load older events on scroll)

**Design:** Vertical timeline with alternating left/right event cards (or single-column for density). Each card: timestamp, butler badge, event icon, one-line summary, expandable details.

### 8. Cost & Usage (`/costs`)

Token usage and cost tracking across the system.

**Components:**
- **Daily/weekly/monthly spend chart** (Recharts area chart): total cost over time, stacked by butler
- **Butler breakdown table**: butler name, sessions count, total tokens (in/out), estimated cost, % of total, trend arrow (up/down vs previous period)
- **Top sessions table**: most expensive individual sessions (by token count), with butler, prompt snippet, cost
- **Schedule cost analysis**: each scheduled task's average cost per run, runs per day, projected monthly cost
- **Anomaly indicators**: sessions that cost >3x the butler's average get flagged

**Data source:** Token counts stored in the sessions table (requires schema addition — see Schema Changes below). Cost estimates derived from token counts × per-model pricing (configurable in dashboard settings).

### 9. Notifications (`/notifications`)

Cross-butler notification history — every outbound message the system has sent to you.

**Components:**

- **Notification feed**: Reverse-chronological list of all notifications across butlers
  - Each entry: timestamp, source butler badge, channel icon (telegram/email), message text, delivery status badge (sent/failed/pending)
  - Failed notifications highlighted in red with error details
  - Click → expanded view with full message, metadata (medication name, contact info, etc.), linked session
- **Filters**: source butler, channel, status (sent/failed), date range
- **Stats bar**: total sent today, failure rate, most active butler, most used channel

**Also appears on:**
- **Butler detail page** — notification sub-section on the Overview tab: "Recent notifications from this butler" (last 5)
- **Overview page** — recent notifications in the activity feed, failed deliveries surfaced in the Issues panel
- **Unified timeline** — notification events mixed into the cross-butler event stream

### 10. Memory System (`/butlers/:name/memory`) — *Contingent on memory plan finalization*

> The memory system is still in planning (see `MEMORY_PROJECT_PLAN.md`). This section will be implemented once the memory schema and MCP tools are built. Included here for completeness.

**Components:**
- **Tier overview cards**: Eden / Mid-Term / Long-Term, each showing entry count, capacity %, oldest entry, newest entry
- **Promotion/eviction activity**: recent promotions (Eden → Mid, Mid → Long) and evictions, shown as a timeline
- **Memory browser**: searchable table of memory entries across tiers
  - Columns: tier badge, content (truncated), tags, reference count, last referenced, created
  - Filters: tier, tag, date range
  - Click → full content view with metadata
- **Memory health indicators**:
  - Eden eviction rate (are we losing too many memories?)
  - Long-term saturation (approaching capacity?)
  - Promotion rate (are memories graduating?)

### 11. Layout & Navigation

**Sidebar navigation:**
```
🔍 Search                (Cmd+K — global search palette)
─────────────
Overview                 (topology + stats + issues)

## Data Flow Examples

### Viewing Butler Status (Read)

```
Browser → GET /api/butlers
  → API reads butler.toml configs to discover butlers
  → API calls status() via MCP client on each butler
  → Returns aggregated list with live health
```

### Triggering a Butler (Write)

```
Browser → POST /api/butlers/health/trigger {prompt: "Log weight 75kg"}
  → API calls trigger(prompt) via MCP client on health butler
  → Health butler spawns CC, CC runs, returns result
  → API returns session result to browser
```

### Browsing Contacts (Read)

```
Browser → GET /api/butlers/relationship/contacts?q=alice
  → API connects directly to butler_relationship DB
  → SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name ILIKE '%alice%' ...
  → Returns paginated results
```

### Viewing Notifications (Read)

```
Browser → GET /api/notifications?channel=telegram&from=2026-02-09
  → API connects to butler_switchboard DB
  → SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE channel='telegram' AND created_at >= ...
  → Returns paginated list with source butler, message, delivery status
```

### Sending a Reminder (Framework Flow — shown for context)

```
Heartbeat ticks Health butler at 08:00
  → Health scheduler: medication-reminder-check is due
  → CC spawns, checks medications table, finds Metformin due
  → CC calls notify(channel="telegram", message="Time to take Metformin 500mg")
  → Health daemon → MCP client → Switchboard.deliver("telegram", message)
  → Switchboard telegram module sends message
  → Switchboard logs to notifications table: {source: "health", channel: "telegram", status: "sent"}
  → Dashboard shows it in /notifications and /timeline
```

### Viewing a Trace (Read)

```
Browser → GET /api/traces/abc123
  → API queries sessions table across butler DBs WHERE trace_id='abc123'
  → API queries routing_log from switchboard DB WHERE trace_id='abc123'
  → Assembles span tree from session data + routing log entries
  → Returns hierarchical span structure
```

## Schema Changes Required

The following additions to the butler framework's database schema are required to support dashboard features:

### Sessions table — add token tracking

```sql
-- Add to sessions table (core schema)
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN input_tokens INT;
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN output_tokens INT;
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN model TEXT;                    -- e.g., 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929'
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN trace_id TEXT;                 -- OTel trace ID for correlation
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN parent_session_id UUID;        -- for trace reconstruction
```

The CC SDK returns token usage in its response. The spawner should capture and store this alongside the session record. `trace_id` enables cross-butler trace correlation.

### Switchboard — notifications table

See the `notify()` core tool section above for the full schema. The `notifications` table lives in the Switchboard's database and logs every outbound message sent by any butler.

### Cost estimation

Cost is **derived, not stored** — computed at query time from `input_tokens × input_price + output_tokens × output_price`. Model pricing is configured in the dashboard API (a simple config file or env var), not in the database. This avoids schema changes when pricing changes.

- [ ] `GET /api/butlers/:name/memory/entries/:id` — single memory detail
- [ ] `GET /api/butlers/:name/memory/activity` — recent promotions and evictions

**Frontend tasks:**
- [ ] **Memory tab** on butler detail page:
  - Tier overview cards (Eden / Mid-Term / Long-Term): entry count, capacity bar, oldest/newest
  - Promotion/eviction activity timeline
  - Memory browser: searchable/filterable table of entries (tier, content, tags, ref count, last referenced)
  - Click entry → full content + metadata view
  - Health indicators: eviction rate, saturation, promotion rate

---

### M12: Polish & Real-Time Foundation

UX polish and groundwork for real-time updates.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Dark mode (Tailwind dark mode with toggle in header)
- [ ] Loading states (skeleton loaders for all data tables/charts)
- [ ] Empty states (meaningful messages when no data)
- [ ] Error boundaries + toast notifications for API errors
- [ ] Responsive design: sidebar collapse on small screens
- [ ] SSE endpoint for live butler status + active session updates
- [ ] Auto-refresh for timeline and session lists (polling → SSE migration path)
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (`/` or `Cmd+K` → search, `g o` → overview, `g t` → timeline)
- [ ] Audit log for dashboard-initiated write operations (triggers, schedule edits, state changes)

## docker-compose additions

```yaml
  dashboard-api:
    image: butlers:latest
    command: ["butlers", "dashboard", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8200"]
    ports:
      - "8200:8200"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://butlers:butlers@postgres/butler_switchboard
      BUTLERS_DIR: /etc/butlers
    volumes:
      - ./butlers:/etc/butlers:ro
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy

  # Optional: frontend dev server (for development only)
  # In production, build frontend static files and serve via dashboard-api
  frontend:
    image: node:22-slim
    working_dir: /app
    command: ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
    environment:
      VITE_API_URL: http://localhost:8200
```

**Production deployment:** Build frontend with `vite build`, serve the `dist/` static files directly from the FastAPI app using `StaticFiles` mount. Single service, no separate frontend container.

## Open Questions

| Question | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Auth for the dashboard? | Not needed for v1 (personal system, localhost). Add basic auth or API key later. |
| How to discover butler MCP endpoints at runtime? | Read butler.toml configs for ports, or use Switchboard's `list_butlers()`. Config-based is simpler and doesn't require a running Switchboard. |
| Trace reconstruction fidelity? | Requires `trace_id` and `parent_session_id` on sessions table (added in M4/M5). Without these, traces are reconstructed heuristically from `trigger_source` timestamps — lossy. |
| Frontend build integration? | `butlers dashboard` in production should serve the built frontend. Need a build step that copies `frontend/dist/` to a location the API can serve. |
| How to handle butler DB schema differences? | API router for each butler type (relationship, health, general) hardcodes the schema knowledge. If a new butler type is added, a new router is needed. |
| Real-time: WebSocket vs SSE? | SSE is simpler for server-push status updates. WebSocket if we want bidirectional (e.g., streaming CC session output). Start with SSE. |
| Token usage from CC SDK? | Need to verify the Claude Code SDK exposes input/output token counts in its response. If not, we may need to instrument at the MCP tool level or parse usage from session transcripts. |
| Cost model pricing config? | Where does the per-model pricing live? Likely a simple YAML/TOML config file or env vars on the dashboard API. Needs to be updatable without redeployment. |
| Module health checks — how? | Modules don't currently expose a `health()` method. We'd need to add an optional `health_check()` to the Module ABC, or the dashboard API probes externally (e.g., Telegram bot API ping, IMAP connect). |
| Global search performance? | Fan-out search across N butler DBs could be slow. Consider: background indexing, materialized views, or a lightweight search index (SQLite FTS) on the dashboard API side. |
| Timeline event sourcing? | The unified timeline aggregates events from multiple tables across multiple DBs. Some events (state changes, heartbeat ticks) aren't currently logged anywhere. May need a lightweight `events` table in each butler DB, or the dashboard API polls and caches. |
| Active session detection? | How does the dashboard know a CC instance is currently running? Options: (1) spawner writes a "running" row to sessions table before spawning, updates on completion; (2) MCP status() tool reports active sessions; (3) SSE push from butler daemon. |
| Memory system dependency? | M11 is blocked on the memory plan finalizing and the `memories` table + MCP tools being implemented. Track this dependency explicitly. |
| Core `notify()` tool dependency? | M7 (Notifications) is blocked on the framework implementing the core `notify()` tool + Switchboard `deliver()` tool + `notifications` table. This is a framework-level change that should be added to `PROJECT_PLAN.md` as a new milestone or task under the Switchboard milestone. |
| Notification delivery guarantees? | What happens if Switchboard is down when a butler calls `notify()`? Options: (1) fail and let CC decide (store in state, retry later), (2) butler-local queue with retry, (3) accept message loss for v1. Recommend option 1 — simplest, CC can handle fallback. |
