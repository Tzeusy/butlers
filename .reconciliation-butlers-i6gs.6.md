# Reconciliation: butlers-i6gs — Spec-to-Code Gap Coverage Audit

Audit date: 2026-02-25
Reconciler: butlers-i6gs.6

## Requirement → Implementation Checklist

| # | Requirement (gap identified in baseline review) | Implementing bead | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `[butler.switchboard]` section missing from general, health, relationship butlers | butlers-i6gs.1 | CLOSED ✓ |
| 2 | Messenger butler.toml had empty `[modules.telegram]` and `[modules.email]` sections with no sub-configuration | butlers-i6gs.2 | CLOSED ✓ |
| 3 | Five approval REST endpoints returned 501 stubs: POST approve, POST reject, POST rules, POST rules/from-action, POST rules/{id}/revoke | butlers-i6gs.3 | CLOSED ✓ (PR #361 merged) |
| 4 | DbAssertion spec used declarative `where`/`column_checks` fields but code uses raw SQL `query` + `expected` | butlers-i6gs.4 | CLOSED ✓ |
| 5 | `tests/e2e/test_cross_butler.py` deleted — only stale `.pyc` remained | butlers-i6gs.5 | CLOSED ✓ |
| 6 | E2EScenario `timeout_seconds` default mismatch: spec said 120, code has 30 | butlers-o7tl (epic dep) | CLOSED ✓ |

## False Positives (excluded from epic scope)

| Item | Reason excluded |
|---|---|
| Telegram Bot lifecycle reactions | Already implemented in `modules/telegram.py` — confirmed false positive |
| InMemorySpanExporter | Used in 10+ test files — confirmed false positive |

## Verdict

All 6 gaps identified in the spec-to-code baseline review have corresponding
implementation beads, all of which are closed. No new gaps discovered during
audit. Epic requirements fully covered.

## Recommended close reason

"All 6 spec-to-code gaps covered and closed: [butler.switchboard] config
(i6gs.1), Messenger module config (i6gs.2), Approval REST endpoints (i6gs.3,
PR #361), DbAssertion spec alignment (i6gs.4), cross-butler e2e restore (i6gs.5),
timeout_seconds default fix (o7tl). Zero gaps remain."
