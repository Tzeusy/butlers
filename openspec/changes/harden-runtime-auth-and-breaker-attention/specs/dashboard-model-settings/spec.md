## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Catalog Test Uses a Runtime Probe, Not a Dashboard-Local Adapter

The Models API's per-entry test and scheduled verification SHALL invoke a
deterministic Switchboard-owned runtime-probe coordinator. The coordinator
SHALL use the same runtime home, authoritative CLI-auth source, adapter
construction, resolved model identifier, and runtime arguments as a new daemon
invocation, but SHALL expose no domain MCP tools and SHALL not create routed
dispatch provenance. A successful probe updates verification evidence only; it
does not close an open breaker.

Scope: v1-mandatory

#### Scenario: Test checks the routed runtime environment

- **WHEN** an operator selects `Test` for a catalog entry or the scheduled
  verification sweep runs
- **THEN** the request is executed by the runtime-probe coordinator using the
  same shared runtime environment and catalog arguments as new daemon work
- **AND** the returned evidence is labelled as a runtime probe rather than a
  routed session result

#### Scenario: Probe success does not close a breaker

- **WHEN** a breaker-open entry's runtime probe succeeds
- **THEN** the API persists its verification result without inserting
  `model_dispatch_attempts.success`
- **AND** the list response and Models page continue to show the entry as
  breaker-open until a later routed success is recorded

#### Scenario: Probe coordinator unavailability is honest

- **WHEN** the runtime-probe coordinator is unavailable or cannot establish
  the authoritative runtime environment
- **THEN** the test response reports the coordinator as unavailable or degraded
  without overwriting the last successful verification evidence
- **AND** the UI does not show a successful model test or a generic provider
  failure for that condition

### Requirement: Model Breaker Attention Episode Visibility and Reissue

The Models list and per-entry detail API SHALL expose the latest relevant
model-breaker attention episode's sanitized lifecycle state, timestamps, and
safe reason independently from verification and breaker facts. The Models page
SHALL make an `uncertain` episode's one permitted manual reissue deliberate:
it presents a confirmation-gated `Send a new alert` control, disables it while
the request is pending or a successor exists, and immediately reports the new
episode result. No other attention state offers an automatic resend control.

Source: heart-and-soul/vision.md Rule 1; RFC 0005; runtime-attention-outbox REQ-runtime-attention-outbox-003; design.md Decision 6
Scope: v1-mandatory

#### Scenario: Independent operational facts are visible

- **WHEN** the Models page renders a catalog entry with verification evidence,
  an open breaker, and an attention episode
- **THEN** it renders those as distinct labelled facts with canonical status
  indicators and safe timestamps/reasons
- **AND** a runtime-probe success explicitly states that it does not clear the
  breaker

#### Scenario: Manual reissue is server-enforced and idempotent

- **WHEN** an operator confirms `Send a new alert` for an `uncertain` episode
- **THEN** the API creates or returns exactly one successor episode for that
  original episode and returns both safe episode identities and states
- **AND** concurrent or retried submissions cannot create additional
  successors for the same original episode

#### Scenario: Non-uncertain episode cannot be resent from the Models page

- **WHEN** a caller requests a manual reissue for a pending, sending, sent,
  failed, or already-reissued episode
- **THEN** the API rejects it without creating an episode or external delivery
- **AND** the UI keeps the control absent or disabled with an accessible reason

#### Scenario: Attention observation degradation stays truthful

- **WHEN** the API cannot read the model's attention-episode source
- **THEN** the response marks that observation unavailable rather than
  returning no episode as a proven no-alert state
- **AND** existing verification and breaker fields retain their independently
  available values
