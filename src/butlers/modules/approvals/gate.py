"""Approval gate — MCP tool dispatch interception for approval-gated tools.

Wraps gated tools at MCP registration time so that:
1. When a gated tool is called, the call is serialized into a PendingAction.
2. Standing approval rules are checked — if a rule matches, the tool
   is auto-approved and executed immediately.
3. If no rule matches, the PendingAction is persisted with status='pending'
   and a structured ``pending_approval`` response is returned to CC.

The wrapping happens at the FastMCP level: tools remain completely unaware
of the approval layer. The original tool function is preserved so it can
be invoked directly after post-approval (by task clc.7).
