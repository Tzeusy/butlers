"""Shared identity resolution utilities.

Provides ``resolve_contact_by_channel`` — the canonical reverse-lookup that
maps a channel identifier (type + value) to a known contact and their
associated roles and entity_id.

Used by:
- Switchboard ingestion path (before routing) to inject sender identity preambles.
- notify() to resolve outbound recipients from contact_id.
- Approval gate to replace name-heuristic with role-based target resolution.

    contact_id:

    Queries ``shared.contact_info JOIN shared.contacts`` to map a channel
    identifier to a known contact record.  Returns ``None`` when no contact
    is found for the given (type, value) pair.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool:
        asyncpg connection pool.  The executing role must have at minimum
        ``SELECT`` on ``shared.contact_info`` and ``shared.contacts``.
    channel_type:
        The contact_info type field (e.g., ``"telegram"``, ``"email"``).
    channel_value:
        The contact_info value field (e.g., a Telegram chat ID string or
        an email address).

    Returns
    -------
    ResolvedContact | None
        A populated ``ResolvedContact`` on success, or ``None`` if no match
        is found or either shared table does not yet exist.

    Notes
    -----
    - The UNIQUE constraint on ``(type, value)`` in ``shared.contact_info``
      (added by core_007 migration) guarantees at most one result.
    - ``entity_id`` is cross-schema (entities lives in the memory butler
      schema); the value is read from the ``contacts.entity_id`` column which
      stores the UUID reference.
    - This function is safe to call if the migration has not yet run —
      it returns ``None`` gracefully.
