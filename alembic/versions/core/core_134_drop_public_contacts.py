"""core_134 — guarded DROP of public.contacts (bu-y6o7q).

Revision ID: core_134
Revises: core_133
Create Date: 2026-06-20 00:00:00.000000

Context (Phase 7.3a-3b — the FINAL, IRREVERSIBLE step)
------------------------------------------------------
``public.contacts`` is the vestigial cross-butler contact registry. Identity
resolution and every live request path were re-pointed off it onto the entity
graph / ``relationship.entity_facts`` (Phase 7 cutover, bu-irphu and siblings).
This migration removes the table itself.

DROP preconditions (all already satisfied by sibling migrations) — every inbound
FK to ``public.contacts(id)`` has been dropped:

- ``core_131`` / ``core_132`` — priority_contacts / home_assistant_persons FKs.
- ``rel_030``                 — the eight relationship-schema child-table FKs.
- ``contacts_005``            — public.contacts_source_links.local_contact_id FK.

This migration is defensive: even if some FK above was missed, step 4 sweeps and
drops *every* remaining inbound FK before the table is dropped.

upgrade() sequence (idempotent, self-guarding, single transaction)
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Guard** the whole body in ``IF to_regclass('public.contacts') IS NOT NULL``
   — a re-run (or a fresh/scoped provision where the table never existed) skips
   cleanly with a NOTICE.
2. **SNAPSHOT** — ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.contacts_dropbak AS TABLE
   public.contacts``. This is the PERMANENT recovery artifact (NOT temp); it
   persists after the drop so the data is recoverable.
3. **PARITY RAISE** — assert ``count(public.contacts) = count(public.contacts_dropbak)``;
   RAISE EXCEPTION (abort, drop nothing) if they differ. Proves the snapshot
   copied every row before we destroy the original.
4. **FK SWEEP** — query ``pg_constraint`` for any remaining inbound FK
   (``contype='f'`` AND ``confrelid = 'public.contacts'::regclass``) and
   ``ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT`` each via a dynamic-SQL loop. RAISE NOTICE
   with the count dropped. This protects against any FK the sibling migrations
   did not cover.
5. **DROP** — ``DROP TABLE public.contacts`` with RESTRICT semantics (the
   default). Inbound FKs are already gone (step 4); if a *non-FK* dependent (e.g.
   a view) still references the table, we detect it first and RAISE a clear error
   rather than silently CASCADE-dropping it.

Cross-chain-migration-drop hazard (cross-chain-migration-drop-hazard)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
``public.contacts`` is *created* by ``core_002`` (this chain) and historically
*written* by other chains' migrations that reach across schemas — notably the
relationship chain's ``rel_003`` (``INSERT INTO public.contacts`` during the
relationship→public consolidation) and its FK (re)creation steps. The full
migration replay (tests/config/test_migrations.py) runs each chain start-to-finish
in sequence, so the *core* chain reaches head — and this DROP runs — BEFORE the
relationship chain runs. Those cross-chain writers are already guarded with
``to_regclass('public.contacts')`` existence checks, so once this DROP has run
they no-op cleanly (the contacts→triples migration is complete and there is
nothing to consolidate). This migration deliberately does NOT recreate the table;
the guards on the writers are what keep the replay order-independent.

Reversibility (data only — structural change is one-way)
--------------------------------------------------------
``downgrade()`` best-effort restores ``public.contacts`` from
``public.contacts_dropbak`` when the backup exists and the table does not
(``CREATE TABLE public.contacts AS TABLE public.contacts_dropbak``). It restores
*row data only* — the dropped inbound FK constraints, indexes, defaults, and
column constraints are NOT recreated (this is a one-way structural change). The
backup table is retained as the durable recovery artifact.
