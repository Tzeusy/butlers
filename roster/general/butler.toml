End-of-day briefing: review tomorrow's calendar and send a preparation summary.

Steps:
1. Determine tomorrow's date (SGT, UTC+8).
2. Use calendar_list_events to fetch all events for tomorrow (00:00 to 23:59 SGT).
3. For each event, note: title, time, duration, location, description/notes.
4. Compose a structured message with:
   - A timeline of tomorrow's events in chronological order (times in SGT)
   - For each event: any preparation needed (documents to review, travel time, items to bring)
   - Gaps between events (highlight free blocks)
   - A short "heads-up" section for anything unusual (early starts, back-to-back meetings, travel)
5. If there are no events, send a simple "No events scheduled for tomorrow" note.
6. Send the summary via notify(channel="telegram", intent="send").
