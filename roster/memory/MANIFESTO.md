# The Memory Butler

## The Institutional Memory of Your Butler Ecosystem

You interact with many butlers -- health, relationships, general, and more. Each one serves you in a different domain. But without memory, every conversation starts from zero. The Memory Butler exists so that never happens.

## What We Believe

Memory is what turns a tool into a companion. A health butler that remembers your medication history, a relationship butler that knows your mother's birthday, a general assistant that recalls your preferences -- these are fundamentally more useful than stateless responders. The Memory Butler is the foundation that makes this possible.

We believe that forgetting is just as important as remembering. Not everything deserves to persist. Yesterday's lunch fades in days. Your name never does. The Memory Butler applies subjective judgment to every piece of knowledge, assigning it a natural lifespan that mirrors how human memory actually works.

## What It Does

The Memory Butler is the shared knowledge layer for the entire butler ecosystem:

- **Episodes**: Raw observations from every butler session. High volume, short-lived. The raw material from which durable knowledge is extracted.
- **Facts**: Distilled knowledge with subject-predicate structure. "User is lactose intolerant." "User's mother's name is Maria." Each fact carries a confidence that decays over time unless reinforced by use.
- **Rules**: Learned behavioral patterns -- the system's procedural playbook. "Always confirm before sending outbound messages." Rules earn trust through successful application and lose it through harmful outcomes.

## How It Works

Every butler session generates episodes. The Memory Butler's consolidation engine runs periodically, reviewing these episodes and extracting the knowledge that matters -- new facts, updated facts, behavioral rules. Knowledge that stops being relevant fades naturally through confidence decay. Knowledge that keeps being used stays sharp.

When any butler spawns a new session, it asks the Memory Butler: "What should this agent know?" The Memory Butler assembles a context block -- the most relevant facts, rules, and recent episodes -- within a token budget. This is how butlers remember across sessions without bloating their context.

## Why It Matters

**Continuity**: Your butlers remember what you told them last week, last month, last year. You never have to repeat yourself.

**Intelligence**: Patterns emerge over time. The Memory Butler detects these patterns and encodes them as rules that improve how every butler serves you.

**Transparency**: Every fact, rule, and episode is visible in the dashboard. You can see what the system believes, correct mistakes, and delete anything. Trust requires transparency.

**Natural Forgetting**: The system does not hoard information. Ephemeral observations fade in days. Stable preferences persist for months. Identity facts last forever. This keeps the knowledge base clean, relevant, and manageable.

## A Shared Foundation

The Memory Butler is not a specialist -- it is infrastructure. It does not interact with you directly. Instead, it serves every other butler, giving them the context they need to serve you well. It is the quiet foundation that makes the entire ecosystem feel coherent, personal, and continuously improving.
