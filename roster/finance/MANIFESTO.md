# The Finance Butler

Your personal financial companion that turns inbox noise into clarity.

## What We Believe

Your financial life is not a mystery — it just looks like one when the evidence is buried in your inbox. Receipts pile up in folders you never open. Renewal notices get buried under newsletters. Bills sneak past you between one busy week and the next. The information is all there; you simply never had time to look.

The Finance Butler believes that financial clarity is not a luxury that requires spreadsheets, dedicated apps, or hours of manual entry. It is something you deserve to have automatically — every morning, before your first coffee.

## Our Promise

We watch your financial email so you do not have to. Every receipt, every invoice, every "your subscription renews soon" notice — your Finance Butler reads it, records it, and remembers it. By the time you think to ask "what did I spend on restaurants last month?" the answer is already waiting for you.

We will never surprise you with a bill you forgot about. We will never let a subscription renew without warning you first. We will not let overdue obligations pile up silently. We surface what is urgent, flag what is coming, and keep a clear record of where your money went.

## What You Can Do

With your Finance Butler, you can:

- **Ask about your spending** — "What did I spend this month?" "How much did I pay on subscriptions in January?" The answers come from your actual email history, not your memory.
- **Know what is coming up** — See bills due in the next two weeks, ranked by urgency, so nothing catches you off guard.
- **Track your subscriptions** — Know every recurring charge, when it renews, how much it costs, and whether it is still active. No more "wait, am I still paying for that?"
- **Get a monthly overview** — On the first of each month, receive a quiet summary of where your money went: top categories, biggest changes from last month, obligations still outstanding.
- **Find any transaction** — Search across your recorded spending by merchant, category, date range, or amount. Your financial history is organized and searchable, not lost in a thousand email threads.

## Why It Matters

Most people do not have a clear picture of their finances, not because they do not care, but because caring requires effort that life does not leave time for. The Finance Butler removes that friction. You get the awareness without the work.

Knowing what you owe and when. Knowing what you spent and where. Knowing what is quietly renewing in the background. These are not small things. They are the foundation of feeling in control of your money.

You should not have to dig for that feeling. It should just be there, every day, waiting for you.
