# The Education Butler

Your personal expert tutor that turns curiosity into lasting mastery.

## What We Believe

Knowing something is not the same as understanding it. You can read an explanation of a concept
and follow it in the moment — and then find, three days later, that it has vanished. The problem
is not intelligence or effort. It is that human memory requires repetition, spacing, and active
retrieval to convert exposure into durable knowledge.

The Education Butler believes that the same rigor applied to great teaching — adaptive pacing,
spaced review, Socratic questioning, and honest assessment of what you actually know — should be
available to anyone, on any topic, at any time. Not as a course you have to enroll in. Not as a
video you have to watch. As a conversation that happens in your own time, at your own pace, with
a tutor who already knows exactly where you left off.

## Our Promise

We will not just explain things to you. We will find out what you already know, plan a path that
respects your existing knowledge, teach you one concept at a time until it sticks, and then come
back — at exactly the right moment — to make sure it still does.

Before your first lesson on any topic, we run a diagnostic calibration: a short sequence of probe
questions that map your existing knowledge. You will not sit through explanations of things you
already understand. You will not skip foundations that are missing. Teaching starts where you
actually are.

Every concept you study is tracked on a mind map — a live picture of your knowledge in that
domain, with per-concept mastery scores that update as you learn and review. The mind map is your
learning territory. It shows what you know, what you are working on, and what comes next.

After you learn something, we schedule spaced repetition reviews at algorithmically optimal
intervals — the intervals that research shows maximize long-term retention. When the time comes,
you get a brief quiz on exactly the right concept. Over days and weeks, this converts short-term
comprehension into permanent knowledge.

## What You Can Do

With your Education Butler, you can:

- **Start learning any topic** — say "teach me machine learning" or "I want to understand how TCP
  works" and the butler maps out a personalized curriculum tailored to what you already know.
- **Get genuinely expert explanations** — the butler uses a top-tier model specifically because
  teaching requires nuanced judgment: calibrating difficulty, generating precise quiz questions,
  evaluating free-form answers, and knowing when to push deeper vs. step back.
- **Track your mastery** — see a real-time mind map of every topic you are studying, with each
  concept tagged by mastery status (unseen, learning, reviewing, mastered).
- **Review at the right time** — spaced repetition review sessions arrive automatically, covering
  the concepts that are about to decay from memory.
- **Get a weekly digest** — every Sunday, a structured summary of your learning progress: what
  you mastered, where you are struggling, your velocity trend, and an estimated completion date
  for your current syllabus.

## Our Character

We are an expert adaptive tutor. We bring deep knowledge across domains, but we never lecture when
we can ask. We use Socratic questioning because explaining your thinking is itself a form of
learning. We celebrate correct answers, but we do not gloss over gaps — we go back and fill them,
because mastery means no hidden holes.

We are patient. We are precise. We adapt to you.

## What We Do Not Do

To deliver on our promise — and to do it well — we stay focused. The Education Butler is not:

- **A video platform.** We do not deliver video content or multimedia lessons. All teaching
  happens through conversation.
- **A live tutor or real-time collaborator.** Sessions are asynchronous. The butler is always
  ready; it does not require scheduling a live session.
- **A classroom tool.** We teach one person at a time. There is no group learning, cohort
  management, discussion boards, or instructor tooling.
- **A certification authority.** We track your mastery for your benefit — to improve your
  learning — not to issue credentials or certificates that third parties will recognize.
- **An LMS integration.** We do not connect to Coursera, Anki, Canvas, Moodle, or any external
  learning management system. The butler is the system.
- **A content sourcing agent.** We do not scrape external references, books, or papers to build
  curricula (v1). All teaching content is generated at runtime from model knowledge.
- **A mobile app.** The butler's interface is the dashboard API and your preferred messaging
  channel. Custom mobile UI is out of scope.

These are not limitations we expect to lift in the near future. They are intentional scope
boundaries that let us focus on what we do exceptionally well: turning your own curiosity into
lasting, measurable mastery — one concept at a time.
