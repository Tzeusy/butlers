# The Travel Butler

Your personal travel companion that transforms booking chaos into organized certainty.

## What We Believe

Your trips are not complicated — your inboxes are. Confirmations pile up from airlines, hotels, and rental agencies. Itinerary changes arrive scattered across a dozen emails. Check-in windows pass unnoticed. Document expiry dates sneak up on you. The information is all there; you simply never had time to organize it.

The Travel Butler believes that travel clarity is not a luxury that requires spreadsheets, printed itineraries, or hours of manual consolidation. It is something you deserve to have automatically — synced, real-time, and ready when you need it.

## Our Promise

We read your travel email so you do not have to. Every booking confirmation, every itinerary change, every check-in reminder — your Travel Butler captures it, organizes it, and remembers it. By the time you reach the airport, your entire trip is already in one place: flights, hotels, reservations, and documents all connected to the right trip at the right time.

We will never let you miss a check-in window. We will alert you to delays and gate changes before the airlines announce them. We will surface upcoming departures, connection times, and document expiry dates with enough lead time to act. We keep every confirmation number, PNR, and reservation detail organized and searchable so nothing falls through the cracks.

## What You Can Do

With your Travel Butler, you can:

- **See your complete trip timeline** — Flights, hotel check-ins, car pickups, activities, and reservations all stitched together in chronological order. One view. All the details.
- **Get notified of changes** — When your flight is rescheduled, cancelled, or delayed, you know before you check your email. Gate changes, terminal changes, rebooking options — surfaced the moment they happen.
- **Never miss a check-in** — Online check-in reminders arrive 24 hours before departure. Early boarding information is flagged. Connection times are verified for tight layovers.
- **Track vital documents** — Boarding passes, visas, insurance policies, and travel receipts are attached to your trip and tracked for expiry. Know which documents are valid and which need renewal before you travel.
- **Find reservations instantly** — Search across all your bookings by destination, date, airline, hotel, or confirmation number. Your travel history is organized and always searchable.
- **Prepare with peace of mind** — Upcoming trips are ranked by urgency so you can focus on what matters next. Pre-trip checklists surface required documents, check-in deadlines, and time-zone adjustments.

## Why It Matters

Most people experience travel as stressful not because the trip itself is complicated, but because the logistics are fragmented and invisible. The Travel Butler removes that fragmentation. You get a single, coherent view of every booking, every change, and every deadline.

Knowing your flights are confirmed. Knowing your hotel is reserved at the right check-in time. Knowing your documents are valid and your seats are assigned. Knowing what is changing and when. These are not small things. They are the foundation of feeling confident and in control when you travel.

You should not have to dig for that confidence. It should just be there, every day until you board — and waiting for you when you return home.
