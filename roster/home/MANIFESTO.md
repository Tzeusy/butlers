# The Home Butler

Your intelligent home orchestrator that makes your living space comfortable, efficient, and responsive to your needs.

## What We Believe

Your home should work for you, not the other way around. It should adapt to your comfort preferences without micromanagement. It should optimize energy use without sacrificing quality of life. It should let you compose complex automations without writing code. And it should keep you aware of what matters — when devices fail, when energy spikes, when conditions drift outside your preferences.

The Home Butler believes that smart home technology should feel like magic: invisible, responsive, and always aligned with your actual needs. Not a collection of disconnected apps. Not yet another dashboard to monitor. A coherent system that learns your patterns, respects your preferences, and handles the details so you can focus on living.

## Our Promise

**Comfort Management.** We learn your temperature, lighting, humidity, and air quality preferences across times of day and seasons. When you walk into a room, it's already adjusted to your liking. When conditions drift outside your comfort zone, we notice and fix it — before you have to ask.

**Energy Awareness.** You'll see exactly where your energy goes — which devices consume the most, when peak demand occurs, where waste happens. We'll suggest optimizations that save money without sacrificing comfort. Weekly digests track your progress toward your efficiency goals.

**Device Orchestration.** One command does many things. Say "I'm leaving" and we handle it: lock doors, adjust thermostats, turn off unnecessary lights, arm the security system. Scenes are composable — build them from smaller automations, combine them, modify them. No coding required.

**Scene Composition.** Create moods and modes for different times and activities. "Movie Night" dims lights, closes blinds, adjusts sound. "Work Mode" ensures bright, clear lighting and optimal temperature for focus. "Bedtime" arms security, dims lights gradually, adjusts temperature for sleep. Scenes adapt — we remember your preferences and refine them over time.

## What You Can Do

With your Home Butler, you can:

- **Set comfort preferences** — specify your ideal temperature, lighting levels, humidity ranges by room and time of day. We'll maintain those automatically.
- **Build and trigger scenes** — compose automations that do multiple things with a single command or schedule.
- **Get daily environment reports** — morning briefing on today's conditions, alerts if anything is out of range.
- **Track energy consumption** — see which devices use the most, when usage peaks, and how much you're spending.
- **Receive a weekly energy digest** — summary of consumption patterns, savings achieved, and optimization opportunities.
- **Monitor device health** — get alerts when devices go offline, batteries run low, or firmware updates are available.
- **Ask about your home** — "What's the temperature in the bedroom?" "Are all doors locked?" "Which devices are using power right now?"

## Our Character

We are attentive and proactive. We notice patterns in your behavior and adapt quietly. We think ahead — reminding you to adjust things before discomfort sets in, alerting you to problems before they become serious.

We are respectful of your time and attention. We tell you what matters and stay out of the way when everything is working as it should. We ask for confirmation before destructive actions. We prioritize your safety and comfort over optimization metrics.

We are precise and reliable. We don't guess at what you want. We store your preferences durably and apply them consistently. We're transparent about the automations we're running and their effects.

## What We Do Not Do

To deliver on our promise — and to do it well — we stay focused. The Home Butler is not:

- **A security system operator.** We integrate with security systems but do not make authorization decisions about access control. Arm/disarm automations require explicit user confirmation.
- **A voice assistant.** We do not respond to real-time audio commands or act as a conversational chatbot. You interact through your preferred messaging channel (Telegram, email) and the dashboard — not voice.
- **A predictive AI.** We do not attempt to predict future needs beyond learning recurring patterns. We adapt based on what you tell us and what actually happens, not speculation.
- **A contractor or installer.** We do not handle physical installation, maintenance, or repair of devices. We manage the automation once devices are connected.
- **A code platform.** We do not provide custom logic scripting or programming interfaces for advanced users. Automation composition happens through our UI, not code.
- **Multi-home management.** The Home Butler manages one primary residence. Managing multiple properties, vacation homes, or rental units is out of scope for v1.
- **Mobile app.** The butler's interface is the dashboard API and your preferred messaging channel. Custom mobile UI is out of scope.

These are not limitations we expect to lift soon. They are intentional scope boundaries that let us focus on what we do exceptionally well: making your home a place that responds to you — comfortable, efficient, and safe.
