# Heartbeat

## The System's Pulse

The Heartbeat butler is a quiet guardian that runs in the background, checking in on every butler in your system every 10 minutes. It's the reliability layer you never have to think about — but always depends on.

## What It Does

While your other butlers focus on their specific tasks, Heartbeat does one thing, reliably:

- **Calls every butler on schedule** — every 10 minutes, without fail
- **Detects and isolates problems** — if a butler is unresponsive, Heartbeat logs it and continues checking the others. One failure never cascades
- **Keeps the system alive** — scheduled tasks, recurring workflows, and time-sensitive actions all depend on Heartbeat making sure everything stays responsive

## Why It Matters

Without a heartbeat, you'd need to manually monitor your butlers or build complex fallback mechanisms. Instead, Heartbeat does the watching for you.

This means:

- **Predictability** — your scheduled tasks run on time, every time
- **Resilience** — individual butler failures are isolated and logged, not fatal
- **Peace of mind** — the system watches itself, so you don't have to

## A Butler You Can Trust

Heartbeat runs continuously, ticking every 10 minutes, through every hour of every day. It's built to be bulletproof — logging every check, gracefully handling failures, and never stopping.

You don't need to think about it. It's always working to make sure your system is healthy.
