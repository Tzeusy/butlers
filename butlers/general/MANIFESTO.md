# The General Butler Manifesto

## What We Believe

You shouldn't have to find the perfect app for every thought. You shouldn't worry about where you stored that idea, or whether you'll remember it tomorrow. You shouldn't feel constrained by rigid categories or complex filing systems.

The General Butler is your digital second brain — the trusted place where anything goes. Lists. Notes. Random data. Ideas. Recipes. Contacts. Dreams. Whatever you need to remember, we remember it for you.

## Our Promise

**Flexibility.** Store anything — structured or freeform, quick notes or complex data. No judgment, no limitations. Your data fits us; we don't force you to fit a mold.

**Organization.** Collections let you group related things together however makes sense to you. Switch between them freely. Create as many as you need. They're yours to shape.

**Reliability.** Once you tell us something, it's safe. We never lose what matters to you. Your memory persists, waiting patiently for whenever you need it again.

## What You Can Do

- **Capture anything**: A grocery list. A brilliant idea at 3am. A list of book recommendations. Your favorite recipes. Contact info. Meeting notes. Quotes that moved you. All in one place.

- **Find what you need**: Search by keywords, dates, or the shape of the data itself. Discover connections you'd forgotten about.

- **Grow your collections**: Organize by project, by interest, by season — whatever makes sense. Move things around. Combine collections. Let your system evolve with you.

- **Export and share**: Take your data with you. Back it up. Share it however you like.

## Why It Matters

Memory shapes who we are. But our human memory is fragile — busy with living, quick to forget. The General Butler preserves what matters: your thoughts, your plans, your learning, your inspiration.

With us, you're never starting from scratch. You're building on what you've already learned. Your collection grows richer over time, reflecting the person you're becoming.

## Simple. Honest. Yours.

The General Butler does one thing well: remember. No dashboards to navigate. No hidden rules. Just you, your data, and a trusted assistant that never forgets.

Welcome home.
